	<h2>Keynote 1: &nbsp;<a href="http://heim.ifi.uio.no/~einarj/">Einar Broch Johnsen</a><br>Mind the Gap: At the Crossroads of Design, Implementation, and Foundations</h2>

<h3>Thursday 23 July 2015, 14:00&ndash;15:30</h3>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>To reduce complexity, general-purpose modeling languages strive for
abstraction. But what is the right level of abstraction? Design-oriented models
capture the logical or physical organization of software, abstracting from
their dynamic behavior. Foundational models capture core features in a way
suitable for meta-theory, but rely on cumbersome encodings of other features.
Specifications close to actual code get obfuscated by the low-level intricacies
of specific implementations.
</p>

<p>This talk reports on research on abstract behavioral specifications, aiming for
a middle ground in the gap between design, implementation, and foundations. We
consider executable, yet abstract models which are faithful to the control and
data flow of concurrent and distributed object-oriented systems, yet abstract
enough to facilitate formal verification. We then consider how novel
technologies such as virtualization and cloud computing reintroduce low-level
concerns at the abstraction level of the models. Deployment decisions form an
integral part of resource-aware, virtualized applications. We discuss how these
technologies raise new challenges for model-based analysis.
</p>

<h3>Bio</h3>
<p>
<a href="http://heim.ifi.uio.no/~einarj/">Einar Broch Johnsen</a> is Professor at the <a href="http://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/">Department of Informatics</a>, <a href="http://www.uio.no">University of
Oslo</a>. His research interests are in the field of software development and
analysis, spanning from programming languages and methodology, via system
specification and modeling, to formal methods and associated theory. Prof.
Johnsen is particularly interested in the analysis of concurrent and distributed
systems, resource awareness and resource management, and mechanisms for software
evolution and reuse. His research in the last years has increasingly focused on
abstract behavioral specification formalisms and their use for model-based
verification of real systems. Prof. Johnsen is currently coordinating the
European research project <a href="http://www.envisage-project.eu">Engineering Virtualized Services (Envisage)</a> which
develops model-based verification techniques to predict the behavior of services
deployed on the cloud.

	<h2>Keynote 2: &nbsp;<a href="http://www.di.ens.fr/~zappa/">Francesco Zappa Nardelli</a><br>Reasoning about C Concurrency and Compilers</h2>

<h3>Friday 24 July 2015, 09:00&ndash;10:30</h3>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>
The C and C++ languages were originally designed without concurrency support, but
the recent revision of the C and C++ standards introduced an intricate but
precise semantics for threads; today's C and C++ compilers, whose optimisers
were initially developed in absence of any well-defined concurrency memory
model, are being extended to support this new concurrency standard. This is a
fantastic opportunity to put at work all our tools to formalise, test, and
reason about large scale semantics and software.
</p>

<p>
In this talk, after recalling the C and C++ memory models, we will explore in a
theorem prover the correctness of compiler optimisations and present simple
necessary conditions that can be used as a reference by compiler implementers.
As an application, we will show how this theory enables building an automatic
compiler fuzzer that hunts &ldquo;concurrency compiler bugs&rdquo;: subtle wrong code
generation bugs which are observable only when the miscompiled functions
interact with concurrent contexts.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps surprisingly, we will also show that by leveraging the semantics of
low-level relaxed atomic accesses (which allows programmers to take full
advantage of weakly-ordered memory operations), it is possible to build
counterexamples to several common source-to-source program transformations (such
as expression linearisation and &ldquo;roach motel&rdquo; reorderings) that modern compilers
perform and that are deemed to be correct. We will evaluate a number of possible
local fixes, some strengthening and some weakening the model, and perhaps
conclude, that, currently, there is no really satisfactory proposal for the
semantics of a general-purpose shared-memory concurrent programming language.
</p>

<a href="http://www.di.ens.fr/~zappa/">Francesco Zappa Nardelli</a> is a Researcher at <a href="http://www.inria.fr/centre/paris-rocquencourt">Inria Paris &ndash; Rocquencourt</a>. His
research interests focus on concurrent computation on top of relaxed
memory models, ranging from hardware models of modern architectures to
high-level programming language specification and compilation. He received his
Ph.D. from Universit√© Paris 7 in 2003.
Since then, he has worked on language design for distributed computation, type
systems for integrating typed and untyped code in scripting languages, and tool
support for semantics (including the Ott tool).
