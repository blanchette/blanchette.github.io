Scope
=====

The TAP conference is devoted to the synergy of proofs and tests, to
the application of techniques from both sides and their combination
for the advancement of software quality.

Testing and proving seem to be orthogonal techniques: Once a program
has been proven to be correct then additional testing seems pointless;
however, when such a proof in not feasible, then testing the program
seems to be the only option. This view has dominated the research
community for a long time, and has resulted in distinct communities
pursuing the different research areas.

The development of both approaches has led to the discovery of common
issues and to the realization of potential synergy. Perhaps the use of
model checking in testing was one of the first signs that a
counterexample to a proof may be interpreted as a test case. Recent
breakthroughs in deductive techniques such as satisfiability modulo
theories, abstract interpretation, and interactive theorem proving
have paved the way for new and practically effective methods of
powering testing techniques. Moreover, since formal, proof-based
verification is costly, testing invariants and background theories can
be helpful to detect errors early and to improve cost effectiveness.
Summing up, in the past few years an increasing number of research
efforts have encountered the need for combining proofs and tests,
dropping earlier dogmatic views of incompatibility and taking instead
the best of what each of these software engineering domains has to
offer.

The TAP conference aims to bring together researchers and
practitioners working in the converging fields of testing and proving
by offering a generous forum for the presentation of ongoing research,
for tutorials on established technologies and for informal
discussions.

Topics of Interest
==================

Topics of interest cover theory definitions, tool constructions and
experimentations, and include among others:

- Bridging the gap between concrete and symbolic techniques, e.g.
using proof search in satisfiability modulo theories solvers to
enhance various testing techniques
- Transfer of concepts from testing to proving (e.g., coverage
criteria) and from proving to testing
- Program proving with the aid of testing techniques
- Verification and testing techniques combining proofs and tests
- Generation of test data, oracles, or preambles by deductive
techniques such as: theorem proving, model checking, symbolic
execution, constraint logic programming
- Model-based testing and verification
- Generation of specifications by deduction
- Automatic bug finding
- Debugging of programs combining static and dynamic analysis
- Case studies combining tests and proofs
- Domain specific applications of testing and proving to new
application domains such as validating security protocols,
vulnerability detection of programs, security
- Testing of verification environments and reasoning engines like
solvers and theorem provers
- New approaches such as crowd-sourcing and serious games to
infer intended semantics and assess correctness
- Formal frameworks
- Tool descriptions and experience reports
